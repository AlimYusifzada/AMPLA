The program was designed to compare pairs of .AAX .AA .BA or .BAX files, using other formats may result in runtime errors. 
Possible combinations: AAX<->AAX; AAX<->AA; AA<->AA; BAX<->BAX; BA<->BAX; BA<->BA							
	
>Code files can be from different source, i.e. can have one extracted from FCB and the other from ONB.

>program automatically detects BA/BAX/AA/AAX files
>
>if database or code is splitted in several files they will be combined together.

> Comparison performed by blocks to block, not line to line

The program try to read and compare numeric constants as numbers, i.e. D=2.3e-3 and D=0.0023 are the same and will not be detected as differnce

If xls report file name ends with *_DIF* it means, descrepancies has found. XLS reports generated by GenXLSreport(code_before,code_after)

Requirements for people who are using source code instead of compiled version 
* use *Python3*. 
* *ampla.py* is a core file contains all functions for parsing and code compare.
* External packages requirements: *tkinter*, *xlwt*, *datetime*
---
**ampla.py** are **Python 3** functions set for **AMPL** code compare/analysis
---
python example to compare **.AA** and **.AAX** files shown below:

>from ampla import *
>
>aa_before = AA('source_code_before.aa')
>
>aa_after = AAX('source_code_after.aax')
>
>print(aa_before.compare(aa_after))
>
>GenXLSreport('source_code_before.aa','source_code_after.aax')

**block** 
    Constructor, create logic block instance,parent for dbinst
    Pins: contain logic block pins (dictionary keys) and values
    Name: logic block name: MOVE,OR,AND,..
    in case of BAX element used to keep instance type: DIC,AIC..
    Address (unique): logic block address: PC12.1.1.2
    in case of BAX element used to keep instance name:
    Extra: the logic block parameters: MOVE(B,16)
    in case of BAX element can keep type of DAT: DAT4 (I)
**AAX**
    Constructor, create AAX file instance, parse AMPL logic
    Blocks: contains all logic blocks from AAX file
    fName: full path to AMPL aax file including file name
    Lines: text lines from AMPL file
    Header: AMPL code header
    Labels: all labels with addresses in the AMPL code
**AA**
    inherit from AAX 
    read (decode) AA file to self.Lines parse AMPL logic
**BAX**
    inherit from AAX
    read (decode) BAX file to self.Lines parse AMPL logic
**BA** 
    inherit from BAX
    read (decode) BA file to self.Lines parse AMPL logic
