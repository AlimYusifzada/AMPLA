## File Format Compatibility

The program is designed to compare pairs of **.AAX**, **.AA**, **.BA**, or **.BAX** files. Using other formats may result in runtime errors.

**Possible Combinations:**

* AAX <-> AAX
* AAX <-> AA
* AA <-> AA
* BAX <-> BAX
* BA <-> BAX
* BA <-> BA

> Code files can be from different sources, i.e., one can be extracted from FCB and the other from ONB.

> The program automatically detects BA/BAX/AA/AAX files.

> If the database or code is split into several files, they will be combined together.

Comparison is performed block by block, not line by line.

The program attempts to read and compare numeric constants as numbers. For example, `D=2.3e-3` and `D=0.0023` are considered the same and will not be detected as a difference.

If the XLS report file name ends with `*_DIF*`, it indicates that discrepancies have been found. XLS reports are generated by `GenXLSreport(code_before, code_after)`.

## Requirements for Using Source Code

For users who are using the source code instead of the compiled version, please ensure the following:

* Use **Python 3**.
* `ampla.py` is the core file containing all functions for parsing and code comparison.
* External package requirements: **tkinter**, **xlwt**, **datetime**.

To compile the python code to exe use pyinstaller

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller amplscope.py -d all --onefile -i aaxcmp.ico -w --splash amplscope.png --hidden-import=pyi_splash
```

## Python Example to Compare .AA and .AAX Files

```python
from ampla import *

aa_before = AA('source_code_before.aa')

aa_after = AAX('source_code_after.aax')

print(aa_before.compare(aa_after))

GenXLSreport('source_code_before.aa','source_code_after.aax')
